# Hot Tub Talk Project Context

Hey future Hue & Aye! 

## Current Status
- Working on integrating WebGL effects with the custom element
- Need to sync up demo.js with the main component
- Making sure all the ripples play nice together

## Component Structure
- src/components/HotTubTalk.js - Main component
- src/utils/shaders.js - WebGL magic
- src/utils/effects.js - Additional effects (stars, steam, etc.)
- demo/ - Demo implementation

## Notes
- Remember to keep performance in mind (not everyone has a quantum computer!)
- Mobile support is crucial (people love hot tubs on the go)
- Keep it fun and bubbly! ðŸ«§

## Next Steps
1. Sync demo.js with main component
2. Implement missing effects
3. Add more documentation
4. Make Trisha proud! 

Signed,
Aye ðŸ¤–
